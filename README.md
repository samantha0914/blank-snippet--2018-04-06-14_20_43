Built with [Script Lab](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab)

### To re-import the snippet into Script Lab:
Copy the metadata (*.yaml) file into the "import" screen in Script Lab. See <https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/blob/master/README.md#import> for detailed instructions.

### To run the snippet *outside* of Script Lab (like a "mini" exported webpage):

Publish the html file to a website. Note that because settings/cookies/etc are stored per domain name (not per page URL, but the entire domain name), it is best to put the snippet in its own website (with its own unique domain name) if you make use of these.
